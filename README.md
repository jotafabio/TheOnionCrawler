# TheOnionCrawler
The Onion Crawler is a project created for the discipline Monographic Subject - Laboratorium at the PWR (Wroclaw University of Science and Technology).
This project intended to be an initial crawler for the The Onion website, which content could be used to populate a dataset used for research purposes on natural language processing. This command-line application helped me to obtain an amount of articles for NLP analysis in a very short time.

It is not intended for production and hasn't been thoroughly tested, it is my first C# command line application.
